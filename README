lan951x-led-ctl is a command line tool to control the LEDs connected to a
LAN9512 or LAN9514 ethernet controller.

Usually those LEDs show the ethernet status like "Link/Activity", "Speed" and
"Duplex" mode. Using this tool you can turn them off, if you don't like
a disco in your room at night ;-) Or you can turn them on/off from any shell
script to show whatever status you wish.

These ethernet and USB controllers are used on many embedded computers like
Raspberry Pi (until Version 3 B - but not 3 B Plus), Olinuxino and many more.
